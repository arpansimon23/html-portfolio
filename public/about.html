<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a business analyst / product management professional who's keen on
  learning more about web development. <br />
  I already have a good understanding of how products are built, how
  requirements are gathered, and how teams collaborate. <br />
</p>

<p>
  However, I realize that learning web development and deepening my knowledge of
  technologies can significantly enhance my ability to communicate with
  development teams and make more informed decisions. <br />
  Gaining this technical understanding will help me bridge the gap between
  business needs and technical solutions more effectively, ensuring that my
  product vision is implemented in a scalable and efficient manner.
</p>

<p>
  By combining my product management experience with a deeper understanding of
  web development, Iâ€™ll be in a stronger position to build better products and
  solve problems more effectively. <br />
  I'll also be better equipped to evaluate new technologies and assess how they
  align with business goals, ensuring to remain competitive in an ever-evolving
  tech landscape.
