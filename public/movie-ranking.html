<h1>Best horror movies or series of all time according to Arpan Simon</h1>

<h2>My top 3 horror movies - </h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Hereditiary </h3>
<p>A truly bone chilling horror movie which is very different from usual horror movies. 
It doesn't rely on a lot of jump scares, rather focuses is on the narrative. </br/>
Caution : This one's not for the faint hearted 
</p>

<h3>Haunting of Hill House</h3>
<p>A masterpiece created by Netflix with a captivating story line and amazing characters. <br/>
    P.S. I've never seen a horror movie / series with such a compelling (and emitional) story.  
    </p>

<h3>Grave Encounters</h3>
<p>One of the older movie - portraying horror from the first person view - similar to blair witch project. <br/>
    This one was the reason for a lot of my childhood nightmares :)
